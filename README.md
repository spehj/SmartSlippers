# SmartSlippers Arduino
This is official SmartSlippers Arduino code repository. We've used Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense for this project.

You can find complete PlatformIO project inside /arduino folder.

Companion Android App written in Kotlin is in another repository (SmartSlippers-Android-Kotlin).

Here you can learn how to use Edge impulse Machine Learning library together with BLE connectivity to recognize movement, detect falls and count steps.
